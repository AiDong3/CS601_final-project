                          HTML helps to structure our website well. 
                          The way a skeleton system gives a structure to the human body in a similar manner HTML acts as a skeleton for a website, without it a website cannot be made. If you want to work as a Software Developer especially in the Web Development domain, then learning HTML is a must, because without knowledge of it you cannot build a website.

                          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to design the webpage to make it attractive. The reason of using CSS is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, 
                          CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.

                  <p>As fundamental web development languages HTML and CSS are a great way to get started with development. This is because these languages offer simple sets of rules that define how to code and are easy to learn. In fact, HTML uses a tag-based structure which is easy to understand even without any prior technical experience, CSS uses a simplistic structure as well making the learning curve for mastery relatively easy. </p>
